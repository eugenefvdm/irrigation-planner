- A legend that counts all items on the map
- Irrigation computer with two line output, e.g. every 2nd day / 8 minutes
- Build landing page with a screenshot of our area
- F11 for full screen mode (for printing)

- The software has the word Irrigation Builder but it's rather Irrigation Planner
    This is usually one of those problems that sorts itself out over time.
